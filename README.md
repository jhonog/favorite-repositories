# Favorite repositories

Hi! Welcome to Favorite Repositories, i will guide you in the instalation procces to get this app on your diveces, let's get started. ;)

## Installation

To clone the project use this command in a terminal, it's free. :D

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jhonog/favorite-repositories.git
```

When you have the project, you will need a couple of complements for proper operation.

First of all you will need Yarn, just execute this command in a terminal.

```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

Once you have yarn installed, you will need the .env file that contains the variables for the database operation.

The download link to this file is secret, and was only sent to people who want to know the application, only cool people ;)

```sh
cd favorite-repositories
```

Make sure that the file is named ".env"

Just a few more steps to go, don't worry.

Now, run the yarn install command in the same rute to load the necessary dependencies.

```sh
yarn install
```

And finally, run the yarn dev command to get the project on your device! Here we go!.

```sh
yarn dev
```
